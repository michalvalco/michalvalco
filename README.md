### Professor of Theology and Religious Studies | Exploring the intersection of faith, philosophy, and the future of Artificial Intelligence

---

I am a Professor at Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia, passionate about understanding how emerging technologies‚Äîespecially AI‚Äîare shaping humanity. My academic work explores the theological and ethical dimensions of transhumanism, human flourishing in the technological age, and the philosophical questions posed by advanced artificial agents.

Recently, I've embarked on a journey to not just theorize about AI, but to build with it. As a beginner coder, I'm actively learning to develop and deploy AI agents using Python and related frameworks, aiming to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern code.
